## 🔧 Tools Used

- **Microsoft Excel** (PivotTables, PivotCharts, Slicers)
- **Data Cleaning** in Excel from raw CSV format
- **Dashboard Layout Design** using custom formatting

## 📈 Key Insights

- The **Technology** category contributed the highest profit.
- **West Region** led in total sales, followed by South and East.
- Certain sub-categories such as **Tables** and **Bookcases** had consistent losses.
- Seasonal spikes observed in **March**, **September**, and **November**


## 🚧 Challenges Faced

- **Data Cleaning:** The raw dataset contained duplicate records, missing values, and inconsistent date formats that required careful preprocessing in Excel.
- **Dashboard Design Constraints:** Designing a clean, interactive dashboard within Excel’s layout limitations required creative formatting using shapes, slicers, and spacing.
- **Performance Optimization:** With thousands of rows, responsiveness of PivotTables and slicers occasionally slowed down, especially on lower-spec machines.
- **Insight Clarity:** Balancing visual appeal and data clarity took iterative redesigns to avoid overcrowding and highlight key metrics effectively.


## 🔄 Process Followed

1. **Data Import & Cleaning:**
   - Removed blank/irrelevant rows
   - Formatted dates and text fields
   - Created calculated columns where necessary (e.g., Month from Date)

2. **PivotTable Setup:**
   - Built multiple PivotTables for sales, profit, and product-wise analysis

3. **Chart Development:**
   - Used line, bar, and pie charts for dynamic visual summaries
   - Ensured each chart was linked to relevant slicers

4. **Dashboard Design:**
   - Aligned visual elements for readability
   - Inserted slicers for interactivity
   - Added KPI boxes for quick insights


## ✅ Final Conclusions

- **Technology** is the highest-performing category in both sales and profit.
- The **West Region** is the top contributor to revenue.
- **Sub-categories like Tables and Bookcases** consistently generate losses.
- Certain months (e.g., **March, September, November**) see sales spikes, hinting at seasonal buying patterns.
- High discounts do not always lead to higher profits.


## 🔮 Future Recommendations

- Integrate this Excel dashboard into **Power BI** or **Tableau** for better scalability and deeper analytics.
- Add **forecasting tools** to project sales and profit based on past trends.
- Use **advanced Excel functions** like Power Query for more complex data transformations.
- Expand the dataset to include **customer demographics** or **returns data** for richer insights.
- Automate data refresh if the source is dynamic, using Power Query or scripts.
